LaTeX workshop-

NOTE= """
latexmk is a Perl script that automates LaTeX compilationâ€”it runs the necessary number of passes of pdflatex, bibtex, etc., to resolve references, citations, etc.

LaTeX Workshop uses latexmk by default as the build tool unless configured otherwise. 
Think of it like a smart wrapper that calls the actual compilers like pdflatex, xelatex, or lualatex for you.
